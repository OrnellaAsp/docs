<h1 id="salesforce-package">Salesforce package</h1>
<p>The core package consists of three custom objects and a set of web services that communicate between Asperato and Salesforce.  The web services are all managed through Apex classes.  The package is designed to be extensible so that the package web service classes can be replaced by custom Apex code if that is required.  </p>
<p>There are simple VisualForce pages to support each of the data objects and tabs accessing these are grouped together into an Asperato application.</p>
<p>The configuration of the package is managed via Custom Metadata.  There are two Metadata Types, Asperato Settings and Service Handler.  The options available for these settings are described below.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The core package is installed using a Salesforce package deployment link.</p>
<p>For a sandbox organisation this link is:<br/>
<a href="https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t240000006Usj">https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t240000006Usj</a></p>
<p>For a live or development organisation this link is:<br/>
<a href="https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t240000006Usj">https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t240000006Usj</a></p>
<p>When installing make sure that the package is accessible by all Salesforce users (this is not the default).<br/>
Once the package has been installed you need to update the system Network Security so that the Asperato servers can communicate with your Salesforce organisation.
As a system administrator go to:<br/>
<strong>Setup &gt; Administer &gt; Security Controls &gt; Network Access</strong><br/>
Add the following Trusted IP Ranges:<br/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start IP Address: 77.68.42.36<br/>
End IP Address: 77.68.42.36<br/>
Description: Asperato Test<br/></p>
<p>Start IP Address: 162.13.56.213<br/>
End IP Address: 162.13.56.213<br/>
Description: Asperato Live<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will need to obtain a reference code from Asperato.  This code is known as the <code>pmRef</code> and this needs to be recorded into a Custom Metadata object.
Once you have obtained the code from Asperato in Salesforce go to<br/>
<strong>Setup &gt; Build &gt; Develop &gt; Custom Metadata Type</strong>s<br/>
In the list that is displayed you will see ‘Asperato Settings’.<br/>
Click on the ‘Manage Records’ link.<br/>
On the list that is then displayed ‘Edit’ the line with the label ‘Default’.<br/>
Change the <code>pmRef</code> value to that supplied to you by Asperato and save the record.<br/></p>
<h2 id="the-data-objects">The data objects</h2>
<p>The package data objects are called <code>Payment</code>, <code>Subscription</code> and <code>Authorisation</code> and they are related to each other as per the diagram below.</p>

<h2 id="the-custom-metadata-type-settings">The Custom Metadata Type settings</h2>
<p>There are two Custom Metadata Types that affect the way that the Asperato Phoenix package operates.</p>
<h3 id="asperato-settings">Asperato Settings</h3>
<p>There is a single record in this Metadata Type with the Label of Default.  When managing this record there are three fields available.</p>
<p>The first of these field is labeled <code>pmRef</code>.  The value for this field is provided by Asperato and relates the Salesforce organisation to the equivalent configurations within the Asperato databases.  You must set this value before using the package to take payments etc.</p>
<p>The second field is labeled <code>Operating Mode</code>.  This is a select box with two options, Test and Live.  Switching this value will automatically switch Asperato server endpoints between the sandbox test environment and the live server environment.  Leave this setting as <code>Test</code> until such time as the live configuration has been established with Asperato.</p>
<p>The third field is labelled <code>Direct Debit Lead Time</code>.  This is a numeric field with a default value of 4 and this represents the number of days before a payment is due that the process of collecting that payment will start.  This is to compensation for the inherent delays in the UK BACS payment system.  This value can be tuned if needed. Under normal circumstances you should leave this value at the default.</p>
<h3 id="service-handlers">Service Handlers</h3>
<p>There are five records in the Service Handlers Metadata Type and these are used to implement overrides to standard package service handlers.  A service handler is an Apex class that processes the data provided in a web service call and builds the appropriate response.  The full details for each of the web services available and how to create the Apex needed is described in the Web Services section.</p>
<p>The only field you can edit for each record is the Handler Name.  This is the name of the Apex class that will be executed for the relevant handler.  The complete list of the Service Handlers and their default values is shown in the table below.  The Interface Name is the name of the interface that the service handler implements.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Label</th>
    <th>Default Handler</th>
    <th>Interface Name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GetAuthorisations</td>
    <td>GetAuthorisationsService</td>
    <td>IGetAuthorisationsService</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GetPayments</td>
    <td>GetPaymentsService</td>
    <td>IGetPaymentsService</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PutAuthorisations</td>
    <td>PutAuthorisationsService</td>
    <td>IPutAuthorisationsService</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PutMessages</td>
    <td>PutMessagesService</td>
    <td>IPutMessagesService</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PutPayments</td>
    <td>PutPaymentsService</td>
    <td>IPutPaymentsService</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="web-services">Web Services</h2>
<p>Each web service consists of an Apex REST endpoint and an associated Apex class that processes the REST request object and builds the relevant response object.  The Apex class that processes the REST data exchange is called a service handler and the actual name of the service handler is driven by Custom Metadata.</p>
<p>So in simple terms to create a new Apex service handler you create a new Apex class that implements the relevant interface and update the Custom Metadata to point to the new class.  Next time that the web service fires, the service handler that executes would be your code rather than that supplied by the Asperato Phoenix package.</p>
<p>There are three sets of web services relating to payments, authorisations and message updates.</p>
<h3 id="payments">Payments</h3>
<p>The two web services that relate to payments are labelled <code>GetPayments</code> and <code>PutPayments</code>.</p>
<h4 id="getpayments">GetPayments</h4>
<p>This gets data from the Payment object and passes this to Asperato so that it can be used to prepopulate the payment page web screen.  The web service has a simple request of a single Salesforce ID and returns a single set of response data.  The field names and usage are shown in the table below.</p>
<p><strong>Request</strong></p>
