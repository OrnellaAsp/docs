<h1 id="asperato-one-salesforce-package">Asperato ONE Salesforce package</h1>
<p>The core package consists of three custom objects and a set of web services that communicate between Asperato and Salesforce.  The web services are all managed through Apex classes.  The package is designed to be extensible so that the package web service classes can be replaced by custom Apex code if that is required.  </p>
<p>There are simple VisualForce pages to support each of the data objects and tabs accessing these are grouped together into an Asperato application.</p>
<p>The configuration of the package is managed via Custom Metadata.  There are two Metadata Types, Asperato Settings and Service Handler.  The options available for these settings are described below.</p>
<p>Note that this package is available for: Lightning Enterprise &amp; Lightning Unlimited only.  For further information please see <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/editions-pricing/sales-cloud/">https://www.salesforce.com/uk/editions-pricing/sales-cloud/</a></p>
<h2 id="design-overview">Design overview</h2>
<h3 id="the-web-journey">The web journey</h3>
<p>The web journey is where a payment or an authorisation is set up via screens that require interaction from a paying person.  This is typically through links in a website, links sent in email communications or direct from Salesforce via a button or a link.</p>
<p>The journey starts with a URL that invokes an Asperato program.  The URL will contain at least one parameter (<code>pmRef</code>) and might have several more.  This are described more fully elsewhere.  The parameters are used to:<br/>
  * Obtain configuration from Asperato using the <code>pmRef</code> parameter.<br/>
  * Obtain data from Salesforce using either the GetAuthorisations REST webservice or the GetPayments REST webservice.  The requests and responses for these services are described fully elsewhere in this documentation.</p>
<p>The Asperato program combines the configuration and the data to create a dynamic web screen that is then displayed to the person making the payment in a web browser.<br/>
The payer then enters data to the web screen and control then passes to another Asperato program.<br/>
This second program accepts and validates the data input and then calls the relevant payment gateway.<br/>
The gateway then returns a response and this is passed back to Salesforce using either or both of the REST webservices PutAuthorisations and PutPayments.<br/>
Asperato then displays the outcome of the whole transaction on either a success or a fail screen.</p>
<h3 id="the-automatic-repeat-payment-journey">The automatic (repeat) payment journey</h3>
<p>The automatic payment journey is the process by which a payment can be taken without the need for screen input on behalf of the payer based on an authorisation that has already been put in place.  This authorisation is typically a Direct Debit mandate or a card continuous payment authority.<br/></p>
<p>The journey starts in Salesforce where suitable code creates a list of payments that are due for collection.  <br/>
This list of payments is then sent to Asperato using a REST web service.<br/>
Asperato then applies validation to each line in the list and either accepts or rejects the individual request line.<br/>
For those lines that are accepted Asperato calls the relevant gateway. <br/>
The gateway then returns a response and this is passed back to Salesforce using either or both of the REST webservices PutAuthorisations and PutPayments.<br/></p>
<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<p>In Asperato terms an Authorisation is a record of an authority given by a payer to collect automatic payments.  This will take the physical form of either a Direct Debit mandate or a card Continuous Payment Authorisation (CPA).  Creating an authority does not take money from the associated account, it merely sets up the mechanism to allow that to happen in the future.  There are rules in force about what you have to tell the payer when you set up an authority and when you take payments using it.  Those rules vary depending on the payment route you are using.</p>
<p>A Payment is a financial transaction.  This can include a refund. Its key attributes are that is has an amount, currency, a due date and a payment route.</p>
<p>In Asperato terms an Automatic or Repeat payment is defined as where:<br/>
The payment frequency is not ‘Single’.<br/>
The payment frequency is ‘Single’ but the payment due date is in the future.<br/>
The payment route is either BACS or SEPA since these require authorisations even for one off payments</p>
<h4 id="payment-scenarios">Payment scenarios</h4>
<p>Basic actions on the data in Salesforce:<br/>
(a) Create new <code>Authorisation</code> row<br/>
(b) Update existing <code>Authorisation</code> row<br/>
(c) Create a new <code>Paymen</code>t row<br/>
(d) Update an existing <code>Payment</code> row<br/></p>
<p>These are the data scenarios that the package is designed to deal with:

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The core package is installed using a Salesforce package deployment link.  That link will be sent to you when you register with Asperato.  To register please go to this link:
<a href="https://test.protectedpayments.net/Register">https://test.protectedpayments.net/Register</a><br/></p>
<p>When installing make sure that the package is accessible by all Salesforce users (this is not the default).<br/>
Once the package has been installed you need to update the system Network Security so that the Asperato servers can communicate with your Salesforce organisation.
As a system administrator go to:<br/>
<strong>Setup &gt; Administer &gt; Security Controls &gt; Network Access</strong><br/>
Add the following Trusted IP Ranges:<br/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start IP Address: 77.68.42.36<br/>
End IP Address: 77.68.42.36<br/>
Description: Asperato Test<br/></p>
<p>Start IP Address: 162.13.56.213<br/>
End IP Address: 162.13.56.213<br/>
Description: Asperato Live<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will need to obtain a reference code from Asperato.  This code is known as the <code>Customer ID</code> and this needs to be recorded into a Custom Setting object.
Once you have obtained the code from Asperato in Salesforce go to<br/>
<strong>Setup &gt; Build &gt; Develop &gt; Custom Settings</strong><br/>
In the list that is displayed you will see ‘Asperato ONE settings’.<br/>
Click on the ‘Manage’ link.<br/>
On the page that is then displayed press the ‘Edit’ button<br/>
Change the <code>Customer ID</code> value to that supplied to you by Asperato and save the record.<br/></p>
<p>There is a regular scheduled task that needs to run each day.  This task will look at the Payment Schedule object and determine whether there are any that are due.  If a Payment Schedule payment is due then this task will create a row in the Payment object for each Payment Schedule.  The task will then look at the Payment object for any rows that are due and will send these as a batch to Asperato for collection.
To set up this job go to<br>
<strong>Setup &gt; Build &gt; Develop &gt; Apex Classes</strong><br/>
At the top of the list that is displayed there is a ‘Schedule Apex’ button.  Press this button.<br/>
A screen will display enabling you to establish the run criteria.<br/>
Enter a Job Name - Suggested name is ‘Asperato Repeat Payment’.<br/>
Next to the Apex Class box press the maginfying glass icon and in the list that displays select ‘BatchProcessSubscriptions’.<br/>
Set the Frquency to ‘Weekly’.<br/>
In the 'Recurs every week on' area tick all the boxes.<br/>
Select a Start date (defaults to today).<br/>
Set an End date.  The default is in one month and you should change this to a value a long time in the future such as 31/12/2050.<br/>
Set the Preferred Start Time to a value, a suggestion would be 04:00 or 05:00.<br/>
Save this record and that will schedule the task.<br/>

<h2 id="the-custom-metadata-type-settings">The Custom Metadata Type settings</h2>
<p>There are two Custom Metadata Types that affect the way that the Asperato Phoenix package operates.</p>
<h3 id="asperato-settings">Asperato Settings</h3>
<p>There is a single record in this Metadata Type with the Label of Default.  This record provides reference data for the URLs needed for Asperato.  There is nothing that can be edited in this Metadata Type.</p>
<h3 id="service-handlers">Service Handlers</h3>
<p>There are five records in the Service Handlers Metadata Type and these are used to implement overrides to standard package service handlers.  A service handler is an Apex class that processes the data provided in a web service call and builds the appropriate response.  The full details for each of the web services available and how to create the Apex needed is described in the Web Services section.</p>
<p>The only field you can edit for each record is the Handler Name.  This is the name of the Apex class that will be executed for the relevant handler.  The complete list of the Service Handlers and their default values is shown in the table below.  The Interface Name is the name of the interface that the service handler implements.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Label</th>
    <th>Default Handler</th>
    <th>Interface Name</th>

<h2 id="web-services">Web Services</h2>
<p>Each web service consists of an Apex REST endpoint and an associated Apex class that processes the REST request object and builds the relevant response object.  The Apex class that processes the REST data exchange is called a service handler and the actual name of the service handler is driven by Custom Metadata.</p>
<p>So in simple terms to create a new Apex service handler you create a new Apex class that implements the relevant interface and update the Custom Metadata to point to the new class.  Next time that the web service fires, the service handler that executes would be your code rather than that supplied by the Asperato Phoenix package.</p>
<p>There are three sets of web services relating to payments, authorisations and message updates.</p>
<h3 id="payments">Payments</h3>
<p>The two web services that relate to payments are labelled <code>GetPayments</code> and <code>PutPayments</code>.</p>
<h4 id="getpayments">GetPayments</h4>
<p>This gets data from the Payment object and passes this to Asperato so that it can be used to prepopulate the payment page web screen.  The web service has a simple request of a single Salesforce ID and returns a single set of response data.  The field names and usage are shown in the table below.</p>

<h4 id="putauthorisations">PutAuthorisations</h4>
<p>This puts data back into Salesforce after a authorisation attempt has been made irrespective of whether that attempt succeeded or failed.  This web service can be bulked up so is capable of sending multiple rows in a single request.  In reality this will only happen for the automated (repeat) journey.  To detect this test the first row of the PutAuthorisationRequestDetails array and examine the value of the Source field.  If this equates to 'Repeat' then you might expect multiple rows otherwise it will be a single element in the PutAuthorisationRequestDetails array.</p>

<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
<p>There are a number of utility functions in the core Asperato ONE package that are available for use for designers and code builds that choose to extend the package.</p>
<h3 id="resolve-the-payment-route-from-text-to-a-code">Resolve the payment route from text to a code</h3>
<p>Asperato uses four character codes to represent the type of transaction that is to take place.  This appears in the repeat payment process.  There is a utility function available that will resolve the text to a code.</p>
<h2 id="customisation">Customisation</h2>
<p>The standard package service handlers can be overlayed with custom versions if that is desired.</p>
<p>The custom class has to implement its appropriate interface and then have code to action that interface methods.  This is a simple example of an class that overrides the handler for the PutPayments web service.</p>
<pre><code>public with sharing class MyOverridePutPaymentsServiceHandler implements asp04.IPutPaymentsService
